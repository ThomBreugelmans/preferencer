# Preferencer

This is a small and simple GUI for selecting the optimal solution, given a set of topics and preferences of a group of people.

## Usage
To use, run the maven application, in the GUI you will find a button "Run", and three sections. 
In the top left section you will add the peoples and preferences.
In the top right section you will select the number of preferences people can give (the text field input) and you can add or remove topics.

Adding topics is done by clicking the + button (same with profiles) and filling out the information.
To remove a topic, select it from the list and click the - button.
It is highly recommended to first add all topics and the people afterwards.

To add or remove people works the same way as with the topics.

After you have added all information, you can click the "Run" button and the algorithm will calculate the optimal solution.
The solution will be printed in the last section in the bottom.
